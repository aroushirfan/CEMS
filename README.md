# CEMS

## Technology Stack

Frontend: JavaFX (Because we are familiar with it)  
Backend: Spring Boot (Because it is the only backend framework we know)  
Database: MariaDB (Because we want to use a relational database, and we are familiar with it)  
Additional Tools & Frameworks: JWT Token (Because it is secure and it prevents users from tampering with the token)
