### 1. Sprint Goal

Build the basic backend (Spring Boot) and frontend (JavaFX) structure, implement core event endpoints, and try to connect FE–BE with initial testing.

### 2. Selected Product Backlog Items

- **US‑1: Add events**  As a faculty/admin, I want to add new events so that they appear in the system.
- **US‑2: Approve events** As an admin, I want to approve submitted events so only valid ones go live.
- **US‑3: View upcoming events**  As a user/faculty/admin, I want to see a list of upcoming events so I can plan ahead.
- **US‑4: Update events**  As an admin/faculty, I want to update event details so information stays updated.
- **US‑5: Delete events**  As a faculty/admin, I want to delete events so outdated or incorrect ones are removed.
