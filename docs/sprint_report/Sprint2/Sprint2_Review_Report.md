# Sprint 2 Review Report
### Duration: 27.01 → 10.02
## Sprint Goal
Build the basic backend (Spring Boot) and frontend (JavaFX) structure, implement core event endpoints, and connect FE–BE with initial testing.

## Completed User Stories / Tasks
- Implemented backend structure (Spring Boot)
- Implemented event endpoints (add, approve, view, update, delete)
- Implemented JavaFX frontend structure
- Implemented events page for upcoming events
- Implemented sign‑up and login pages
- Connected frontend and backend with initial testing
- Implemented JWT authentication
- Implemented role‑based authorization
- Wrote unit tests and generated coverage report using JaCoCo

## Demo Summary
The working backend and frontend connection, event management features, user account creation and login, and the functioning authentication and authorization flow. Unit test execution and coverage reporting.

## What Went Well
- Smooth integration between frontend and backend
- Completed most planned tasks on time
- Successful implementation of authentication and authorization despite not being planned
- Good communication and collaboration among team members
- Effective use of Trello for task tracking and management

## What Could Be Improved
- Well most of the things went smooth but maybe a bit more time could have been allocated for testing and longed for better or more online resources for designing the UI using JavaFX.

## Next Sprint Focus
Sprint 3 will focus on extending the functional prototype, integrating CI/CD with Jenkins, and preparing a local Docker image to support deployment workflows.
